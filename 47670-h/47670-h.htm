<p class='pindent'>In the absence of any suitable biography of the author of
“The Clockmaker,” his centenary may lend an interest
to the following brief sketch of his life and times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born at Windsor, in
the Province of Nova Scotia, on the 17th day of December,
1796. He was descended from the Haliburtons of Mertoun
and Newmains, a Border family, one of whom was Barbara
Haliburton, only child of Thomas Haliburton, of Newmains,
who married Robert Scott, and whose second son
was Walter Scott, the father of the immortal Sir Walter.
Her eldest son left numerous descendants. Sir Walter’s tomb
is in the ancient burial place of the Haliburtons, St. Mary’s
Aisle, in Dryburgh Abbey. About the beginning of the last
century nearly all of her numerous uncles migrated to
Jamaica, and the eldest of them, Andrew Haliburton, removed
thence to Scituate, near Boston, Massachusetts, where
he, and, subsequently, his son William, married members of
the Otis family, to which the well-known James Otis
belonged. William Haliburton (whose cousin, Major John
Haliburton, Clive’s colleague, was, according to Mill’s History
of India, “the Founder of the Sepoy force,”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>) removed to
Nova Scotia with many persons from Scituate, when the
vacant lands of the Acadian French were offered to settlers.
His son, the Hon. William Hersey Otis Haliburton, Chief
Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, in Nova Scotia, married
Lucy Grant, a daughter of Major Alexander Grant, one
of Wolfe’s Highland officers at the siege of Quebec, who,
after the French war, settled in the colony of New York,
where he married a Miss Kent, a near relative of the famous
Chancellor Kent. He was killed in the Revolutionary War,
at the storming of Fort Stanwix, while in command of the
New York Volunteers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chief Justice William Hersey Otis Haliburton left an only
child, the future author of “Sam Slick,” who was educated
at the Grammar School, Windsor, and afterward, at the same
place, at the University of King’s College, for Tory King’s
College of the Colony of New York had migrated to
Windsor, Nova Scotia, where, preserving the traditions
of Oxford of olden times, it remained out and out Tory in
its politics, and continued unchanged, even after Oxford itself
had long felt the influence of modern ideas. In its collegiate
school, as late at least as 1845, that venerable heirloom,
“Lilly’s Latin Grammar,” which had not a word of English
from cover to cover, and which was a familiar ordeal for boys
long before Shakespeare was born (Cardinal Wolsey, it is
said, assisted in its composition), was still employed. It even
retained the quaint old frontispiece representing boys with
knee-breeches and shoebuckles (probably a picture of the
original “Blue-coat Boys”) climbing up the tree of knowledge,
and throwing down the golden fruit. Daily, too, at
the meals in the College Hall there was, and perhaps may
be to this day, heard a quaint Latin grace, which was droned
by the “senior scholar,” beginning, <span class='it'>Oculi omnium ad te spectant,
Domine</span>; probably the same that was heard in some college
halls in the days of the Crusades. It is to be hoped that the
“spirit of the age” has not led it to discard this and other
venerable heirlooms derived from an ancient ancestry. This
truly conservative and orthodox institution, in which the
future author was crammed with classics, and taught to
“fear God and honour the King,” was then considered one of
the most successful educational institutions in America, and
it still ranks high in its reputation as a college. It is the
oldest in the Colonies, and it is the only one that has a Royal
Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Haliburton used often to puzzle his friends by saying
that <span class='it'>he and his father were born twenty miles apart, and in
the same house</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enigma throws some light on the early history of
Windsor. His father had extensive grants of land at
Douglas, a place situated at the head waters of the St.
Croix, a tributary of the Avon, as to which there is a gruesome
tablet at St. Paul’s Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia, to
the memory of a nobleman, who lost his life “from exposure
during an inclement winter, while settling a band of brave
Carolinians” at Douglas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The famous Flora McDonald, whose husband was a captain
in that regiment, spent a winter in Fort Edward, the old
blockhouse of which still overlooks the village of Windsor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house at Douglas was built in the middle of the last
century, like a Norwegian lodge, of solid timber covered
with boards. When Mr. Haliburton’s father removed from
Douglas it was floated down the river, and was placed on the
bank of the Avon, where the town of Windsor now is, and
in it Mr. Haliburton was born. The tide there is very remarkable,
as it rises over thirty-six feet; and while at high tide
hundreds of <span class='it'>Great Easterns</span> could float there, when the tide
is out the river dwindles into a rivulet, lost in a vast expanse
of square miles of chocolate. The village early in the
century consisted of one straggling street along the river
bank, under green arches formed by the meeting of the
boughs of large elms, a pretty little <span class='it'>Sleepy Hollow</span>, the quiet
of which was only at times disturbed by the arrival from
Halifax of a six-horse stage-coach at full gallop, or by the
melancholy whistle of a wheezy little steamer from St. John,
New Brunswick. The limited society of the place, a bit of
rural England which had migrated, was far more exclusive
and aristocratic than that now found in Halifax, or any
Canadian city (for a shop-keeper or retailer, however wealthy,
could not get the <span class='it'>entrée</span> to it), and was composed mainly of
families of retired naval and military officers, “U.E. Loyalists,”
professional men, Church of England clergy, and professors
at the College, and also one or two big provincial
dignitaries, with still bigger salaries, who had country seats
where they spent their summers. The officers, too, of a
detachment of infantry stationed there largely contributed
to break the monotony of the place.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-6.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0001' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Clifton, Windsor, N.S.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The migratory house was in time succeeded by a much
more commodious one, built almost opposite to it; and this,
in its turn, soon after Mr. Haliburton was made a Judge,
was deserted for what was his home for a quarter of a century,
Clifton, a picturesque property to the west of the village,
consisting in all of over forty acres, bounding to the eastward
on the village, to the north on the river, and to the south on
the lands of King’s College. Underlaid by gypsum, it was
much broken up and very uneven; and the enormous amount
of earth excavated in opening up the gypsum quarries was
all needed to make the property a comfortable and suitable
place of residence. Lord Falkland, a Lieutenant-Governor
of Nova Scotia, used to say that he had never seen any place
of its size that had such a variety of charming scenery. One
precipitous, sunny bank, about one hundred and fifty feet
long and thirty feet high, became a dense thicket of acacias,
and when they were in bloom, was one mass of purple
and white blossoms, while pathways wandered up and down
through gleaming spruce copses and mossy glades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of its special points of interest was the “Piper’s
Pond,” so named after a probably mythical piper of a
Highland regiment, who, having dropped his watch into the
water, dived after it, and never came up. It was one of the
few “punch-bowls” in gypsum regions that are not found
dry.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-11.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0002' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>The Piper’s Pond.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a landscape gardener, he was greatly aided by the
thorough art training his assistant had obtained at the best
ladies’ school of her day—one at Paris supported by the old
<span class='it'>Noblesse</span>. Her history, from early childhood to the time
when she arrived at Windsor, the youthful bride of Mr.
Haliburton, who himself was still a minor, was a singular
succession of romantic incidents. She was a daughter of
Captain Laurence Neville, of the 19th Light Dragoons, and
as she was very young when her mother died, her father,
having made provision for her support and education before
rejoining his regiment in India,<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> left her in charge of the
widow of a brother officer, a sister of Sir Alexander Lockhart,
who subsequently, unknown to him, married William Putnam
McCabe, a man of means, who became the Secretary of
“the United Irishmen” of ’98. When he escaped to
France in an open smuggler’s boat, he took with him his
wife and also her ward, Miss Neville; and in 1816, the year
the latter was married, in spite of the ten thousand pounds
placed on his head he secretly went to England to bid her
good-bye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before the thrilling tales of his escapes from the
troops in pursuit of him, and other adventures, appeared in
Madden’s “History of the United Irishmen,” they had been
household words in the nursery at Clifton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of her marriage was equally romantic. When
her father, who was living at Henley-on-Thames in 1812,
was on his death-bed, he heard that a very old military friend,
named Captain Piercy, was living not far from that place,
and he therefore wrote to him, asking him to call on Miss
Neville, and to render her such services as she might need
until the arrival of her only brother, who was then in India
with his regiment, the 11th Hussars. He died in ignorance
of the fact that he had written to a perfect stranger, an old
retired naval officer of that name, who, with his wife, on
receipt of the letter, called on Miss Neville, and invited
her, as they had no children, to make their house her
home. His step-nephew, Mr. Haliburton, while on a visit
to England, met her at his house, and though still a minor,
became engaged to and married her. The memory of these
incidents was long preserved in the local traditions of
Henley-on-Thames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Haliburton, who had graduated with honors on leaving
college, in time was called to the bar, and practised at
Annapolis Royal, the former capital of Nova Scotia, where
he acquired a large and lucrative practice; but a wider sphere
of action was opened to him when he became the representative
of the county of Annapolis, and, as such, by his power
of debate and his ability, he speedily attained a leading
position.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the first public man who in a British Legislature
successfully advocated the removal of Roman Catholic disabilities.
Speaking of his speech on that occasion, Mr.
Beamish Murdoch, in his “History of Nova Scotia,” says it
was “the most splendid bit of declamation that it has ever
been my fortune to listen to. He was then in the prime of
life and vigor, both mental and physical. The healthy air of
country life had given him a robust appearance, though his
figure was yet slender and graceful. As an orator, his
manner and attitude were extremely impressive, earnest and
dignified; and, although the strong propensity of his mind to
wit and humor was often apparent, they seldom detracted from
the seriousness of his language, when the subject under discussion
was important. Although he sometimes exhibited
rather more hauteur than was agreeable, yet his wit was
usually kind and playful. On this occasion he absolutely
entranced his audience. He was not remarkable for readiness
of reply in debate; but when he had time to prepare his
ideas and language he was almost always sure to make an
impression on his hearers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this point Mr. Duncan Campbell, in his “History of
Nova Scotia” (p. 334), says: “The late Mr. Howe spoke of
him to the writer as a polished and effective speaker. On
some passages of his more elaborate speeches he bestowed
great pains, and in the delivery of them, Mr. Howe, who
acted in the capacity of a reporter, was so captivated and
entranced that he had to lay down his pen and listen to his
sparkling oratory. It is doubtless to one of these passages
that Mr. Beamish Murdoch refers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to imagine a more uninviting arena than
was presented at that time by Nova Scotian politics, or more
undesirable associates in public life than the politicians of
that day. The Province was ruled over by a Council consisting
of a few officials living at Halifax, one of the leaders of
which was the Church of England Bishop. In vain, therefore,
year after year Mr. Haliburton got the House to vote
a grant to a Presbyterian institution, the Pictou Academy.
It was invariably rejected by the Council; while a small
grant in aid of public schools was contemptuously rejected
without any discussion as to it. His ridicule of the
conduct of the Council in that matter gave them great
offence, and they demanded an apology from the House,
which, however, was refused, as the House resolved that there
was nothing objectionable in his remarks, and also that they
were privileged. The Council again more peremptorily demanded
an apology, when the House, incredible as it may
seem, unanimously stultified itself by resolving that Mr.
Haliburton should be censured for his remarks. He accordingly
attended in his place, and was censured by the Speaker!
It must, therefore, have been an infinite relief, when an
opportunity offered of escape from such an ordeal as public
life was in those days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lived in the district embraced by the Middle Division
of the Court of Common Pleas, of which his father was Chief
Justice, while he himself was the leader on that circuit.
When, therefore, his father died, the vacant post was, as a
matter of course, offered to him, and was gladly accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Pictou County, which was largely settled by
“dour” Cameronians, and which gloried in those annual and
ever-recurring battles against the Bishop and his followers,
there are no doubt types of “Old Mortality” that will never
cease to denounce his retirement from the perennial strife as
a great sin, and an act of treason to his country, or (what is
the same thing) to the Pictou Academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1828, when only thirty-two years of age, he received the
appointment of Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.
In 1841 the Court of Common Pleas was abolished, and his
services were transferred to the Supreme Court. In
February, 1856, he resigned his office of a Judge of that
Court, and soon afterwards removed to England, where he
continued to reside till his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a curious instance of “the irony of fate,” when the
successful advocate of the removal of the political disabilities
of Roman Catholics was a quarter of a century afterwards
called on as a Judge to rule that the rights of Roman
Catholic laymen, as British subjects, could not be restricted
by any ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carten, a very prominent and respected Irishman living
in Halifax, having been excommunicated, was denied access
to his pew in St. Mary’s Cathedral, of which he was <span class='it'>the
legal owner</span>. Judge Haliburton’s ruling in favor of the
plaintiff in Carten <span class='it'>vs.</span> Walsh <span class='it'>et al.</span> was a very able one.
This was probably the only case in which a judge in Nova
Scotia ever had to order a court room to be cleared in consequence
of manifestations of public excitement and feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About 1870 the same point was raised at Montreal in
the famous “Guibord case.” The members of a French-Canadian
literary society, which had refused to have standard
scientific works weeded out of its library, were excommunicated.
One of them, named Guibord, had bought and was
the legal owner of a lot in the public cemetery at Montreal,
and, when he died, his body was refused admission to it.
Though this proceeding was justified by the Quebec courts,
their judgments were reversed by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council; and upon the defendants refusing to obey
“the order of Her Majesty in Council in the matter,” some
thousands of troops were called out, and the body, under
military protection, was buried under several feet of Portland
cement in the Guibord lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the ruling in Carten <span class='it'>vs.</span> Walsh <span class='it'>et al.</span> created some
bitter enemies that were powerful enough to make their
hostility felt, some offence (perhaps not altogether without
apparent cause) may also have been taken by them at
a few incidental philosophical allusions in “Rule and
Misrule of the English in America” to the important
results that were likely to flow from the new rôle of the
Roman Catholic Church as a political power in the New
World, a subject that he would no doubt have prudently
avoided could he have foreseen the bitter controversy as to
that question that was about to be caused by the rise of the
“Know-nothing Movement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanks to that wonder-worker, <span class='it'>Time</span>, the lapse of fifty
years rarely fails to take all the caloric out of “burning
questions,” and is able to convert the startling forecasts of
thinkers into the trite truisms of practical politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The animus against him, however, was probably of a persistent
type. “From the ills of life,” says Longinus, “there
is for mortals a sure haven—death, while the woes of the
gods are eternal.” But successful authors are not much
better off than the unlucky gods, for their names and their
works survive them and can be <span class='it'>tabooed</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The generous tribute from the Archbishop of Halifax and
Mr. Senator Power, at the Haliburton Centenary meeting
at Halifax, to the important services he had rendered three-quarters
of a century ago, is a pleasing proof that a public
man may safely do his duty and leave his life to the impartial
verdict of a later generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years after taking up his residence in England, he
paid a visit to Ontario, Canada, where he negotiated the purchase
by the Canadian Land and Immigration Company of an
extensive tract of country near Peterborough. Most of it
that is not now sold is included in the county of Haliburton,
which returns a member to the Ontario Legislature, and the
county town of Haliburton is the terminus of the Haliburton
branch of the Grand Trunk Railway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1816, as already stated, he married Louisa, only daughter
of Captain Laurence Neville, of the 19th Light Dragoons (she
died 1840), by whom he had a large family.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> And secondly,
in 1856, Sarah Harriet, widow of Edward Hosier Williams,
of Eaton Mascott, Shrewsbury, by whom he had no issue, and
who survived him several years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That life-long exile, the poet Petrarch, says that men, like
plants, are the better for transplanting, and that no man
should die where he was born. For years Judge Haliburton
stagnated and moped in utter solitude at Clifton, for his large
family had grown up and were settled in life elsewhere, while
death had removed the little band of intellectual companions
whose society had been a great source of enjoyment to him.
But he got a new lease of life by migrating to England. His
second wife was a very intelligent and agreeable widow lady
of a good social position, who even after having made a considerable
sacrifice of her means in order to marry him, was
comfortably off. It was a very happy match, and she proved
to be a most devoted wife. Before they were married she
had leased Gordon House, situated on the Thames, not
far from Richmond (a house built by George I. for the
Duchess of Kendal, who after his death believed that her
royal lover used to visit her in the form of a crow in what
is still known as “The haunted room”). In time the gardens
and grounds there were referred to as showing what lady
floriculturists can accomplish. His family, most of whom
resided in England, were delighted at seeing him in his old
age well cared for in a comfortable home.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-16.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Gordon House, Isleworth.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As an author, he first came before the public in 1829, as the
historian of his native Province. His work, which was
well received by both the public and the press, and was so
highly thought of that the House of Assembly tendered him
a vote of thanks, is to the present time regarded as a standard
work in the Province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six years subsequently he became unconsciously the author
of the inimitable “Sam Slick.” In a series of anonymous
articles in the <span class='it'>Nova Scotian</span> newspaper, then edited by Mr.
Joseph Howe, he made use of a Yankee peddler as his mouthpiece.
The character proved to be “a hit,” and the articles
greatly amused the readers of that paper, and were widely
copied by the American press. They were collected together
and published anonymously by Mr. Howe, of Halifax, and
several editions were issued in the United States. A copy
was taken thence to England by General Fox, who gave it to
Mr. Richard Bentley, the publisher. To Judge Haliburton’s
surprise, he found that an edition that had been very favorably
received had been issued in England. For some time the
authorship was assigned to an American gentleman in London,
until Judge Haliburton visited England and became known
as the real author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his “Sam Slick” he received nothing from the
publisher, as the work had not been copyrighted, but Mr.
Bentley presented him with a silver salver, on which was an
inscription written by the Rev. Richard Barham, the author
of the “Ingoldsby Legends.” Between Barham, Theodore
Hook and Judge Haliburton an intimacy sprang up. They
frequently dined together at the Athenæum Club, to which
they belonged, and many good stories told by Hook and Barham
were remembered by the Judge long after death had
deprived him of their society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards “Sam Slick,” he never expected that his name
would be known in connection with it, or that his productions
would escape the usual fate of colonial newspaper articles.
On his arrival in London, the son of Lord Abinger (the
famous Sir James Scarlett) who was confined to his bed,
asked him to call on his father, as there was a question which
he would like to put to him. When he called, his Lordship
said, “I am convinced that there is a veritable Sam Slick in
the flesh now selling clocks to the Bluenoses. Am I right?”
“No,” replied the Judge, “there is no such person. He was
a pure accident. I never intended to describe a Yankee
clockmaker or Yankee dialect; but Sam Slick slipped into
my book before I was aware of it, and once there he was
there to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some respects, perhaps, the prominence given to the
Yankee dialect was a mistake, for, except in very isolated
communities, dialect soon changes. A Harvard professor,
nearly fifty years ago, indignantly protested against Sam
Slick being accepted “as a typical American.” His indignation
was a little out of place. It would be equally foolish in
an Englishman should he protest against Sam Weller being
regarded as a typical Englishman. Do typical Americans
wander about in out-of-the-way regions selling wooden clocks?
Sam Slick represented a very limited class that sixty years
ago was seen oftener in the Provinces than in the United
States, but we have the best proof that The Clockmaker
suggested a true type of some “Downeasters” of that day in
the fact that the people of many places in the North-eastern
States were for many years convinced that they had among
them the original character whom Judge Haliburton had
met and described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sixty years ago the Southern States were familiar with the
sight of Sam Slicks, who had always good horses, and whose
Yankee clocks were everywhere to be seen in settlers’ log
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Sam Slick’s day the itinerant vendor of wooden
clocks has moved far west, and when met with there, is a
very different personage from Sam Slick. Within the past
forty years, however, veritable Sam Slicks have occasionally
paid a visit to Canada. One of them sold a large number of
wooden clocks throughout Nova Scotia and Cape Breton.
They were warranted to keep accurate time for a year, and
hundreds of notes of hand were taken for the price. The
notes passed by indorsement into third hands, but, unfortunately,
the clocks would not go. Actions were brought in
several counties by the indorsees, and the fact that Seth’s
clocks had stopped caused as much lamentation and dismay
as a money panic. The first case that came up was tried
before Judge Haliburton, much to the amusement of the
public and to the edification of the Yankee clockmaker, who
had a long homily read to him on the impropriety of cheating
Bluenoses with Yankee clocks that would do anything sooner
than keep time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a man may be a Yankee clockmaker without having
the “cuteness” and common sense of Sam Slick. In his
<span class='it'>Early Reminiscences</span>, Sir Daniel Lysons describes such an one
who, while selling clocks in Canada, was tempted to stake his
money and clocks, etc., on games of billiards with a knowing
young subaltern. “The clocks soon passed into British possession.
They then played for the waggon and horse. Finally,
Sam Slick, pluck to the backbone, and still confident, staked
his broad-brimmed hat and his coat; Bob won them; and
putting them on in place of his own, which he gave to his
friend Sam, he mounted the waggon and drove into barracks
in triumph, to the immense amusement of the whole garrison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An English Reader has for half a century been in use in
French schools, which gives Sam Slick’s chapter on “Buying
a Horse” as one of its samples of classical English literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Experience is proving that the value attached by Sam
Slick to the geographical position and natural advantages of
the Province of Nova Scotia was not a mistaken one. We
are, however, apt to be more grateful to those that amuse
than to those who instruct us. Many persons who laughed
at Sam Slick’s jokes did not relish his truths, and his popularity
as an author was far greater out of Nova Scotia than
in it; but it had ceased to depend on the verdict of his
countrymen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artemus Ward pronounced him to be the “father of the
American school of humor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The illustrations of the Clockmaker by Hervieu, and of
Wise Saws by Leech, supplied the conventional type of
“Brother Jonathan,” or “Uncle Sam,” with his shrewd smile,
his long hair, his goatee, his furry hat, and his short striped
trousers held down by long straps, a precise contrast to the
conventional testy, pompous, pot-bellied John Bull, with his
knee-breeches and swallow-tail coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among all the numerous notices of Sam Slick’s works that
have appeared from time to time, that by the <span class='it'>Illustrated
London News</span>, on July 15th, 1842, which was accompanied
by an excellent portrait of Judge Haliburton, is the most
discriminating and appreciative.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam Slick’s <span class='it'>entrée</span> into the literary world would appear to
have been in the columns of a weekly Nova Scotian journal,
in which he wrote seven or eight years ago a series of
sketches illustrative of homely American character. There
was no name attached to them, but they soon became so popular
that the editor of the <span class='it'>Nova Scotian</span> newspaper applied
to the author for permission to reprint them entire; and this
being granted, he brought them out in a small, unpretending
duodecimo volume, the popularity of which, at first confined
to our American colonies, soon spread over the United States,
by all classes of whose inhabitants it was most cordially welcomed.
At Boston, at New York, at Philadelphia, at Baltimore,
in short, in all the leading cities and towns of the
Union, this anonymous little volume was to be found on the
drawing-room tables of the most influential members of the
social community; while, even in the emigrant’s solitary
farm house and the squatter’s log hut among the primeval
forests of the Far West, it was read with the deepest interest,
cheering the spirits of the backwoodsman by its wholesome,
vigorous and lively pictures of every-day life. A recent
traveller records his surprise and pleasure at meeting with a
well-thumbed copy in a log hut in the woods of the Mississippi
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The primary cause of its success, we conceive, may be
found in its sound, sagacious, unexaggerated views of human
nature—not of human nature as it is modified by artificial
institutions and subjected to the despotic caprices of fashion,
but as it exists in a free and comparatively unsophisticated
state, full of faith in its own impulses and quick to sympathize
with kindred humanity; adventurous, self-relying, untrammelled
by social etiquette; giving full vent to the emotions
that rise within its breast; regardless of the distinctions of
caste, but ready to find friends and brethren among all of
whom it may come in contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is the human nature delineated in Sam Slick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another reason for Sam Slick’s popularity is the humor
with which the work is overflowing. Of its kind it is
decidedly original. In describing it we must borrow a
phrase from architecture, and say that it is of a ‘composite
order;’ by which we mean that it combines the qualities of
English and Scotch humor—the hearty, mellow spirit of the
one, and the shrewd, caustic qualities of the other. It derives
little help from the fancy, but has its ground-work in the
understanding, and affects us by its quiet truth and force
and the piquant satire with which it is flavored. In a word—<span class='it'>it
is the sunny side of common sense</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A review of “Nature and Human Nature” drew attention
to the fact that no writer has produced purer conceptions of
the female character than are to be found in Sam Slick’s
works. They show none of those morbid, sexualistic
tendencies which are betrayed in some modern novels written
by young ladies, or in semi-scientific papers on sexual subjects
by “advanced females.” Tacitus praised the social purity of
the Germans at the expense of his corrupt fellow-countrymen.
“No one there makes a jest of vice,” which we may now read,
“No one there writes novels about adultery.” Sam Slick
tells us how he romped and flirted with country girls; but in
all he has written there is not the slightest trace of impropriety,
even by the most remote implication. There is no
harm in Sam Slick’s jokes, which were originally intended for
rough, plain-spoken backwoods Bluenoses of sixty years ago;
for, while impurity corrupts, however refined it may be,
coarseness does not. The Bible is often coarse, but never
impure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some years before Sydney Smith made what is generally
set down as his best joke, as to a day being so hot that it
would be a comfort to “<span class='it'>take off our flesh and sit in our
bones</span>,” it had made its appearance in “Sam Slick;” and
the country girl who says, “I guess I wasn’t brought up at
all, I growed up,” probably suggested Topsy’s, “spec I
growed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this sketch had been written, a somewhat startling
suggestion, that the idea of The Clockmaker had been
borrowed from Dickens, and that Sam Slick was merely a
Yankee version of Sam Weller, led to an inquiry into the
point. The coincidences were many, and could hardly be
accidental. Dickens sends off Pickwick in his wanderings
without any apparent object in view, accompanied by a
shrewd and humorous Cockney valet, whose sayings and
doings are the prominent feature of the book; while Judge
Haliburton sends off the author on very similar travels,
accompanied by a cute Yankee, for whose yarns and jokes
the book is simply a peg on which they can be hung. In
both cases there is the faintest apology for a connected story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any one had been guilty of plagiarism, it was Dickens,
for the first number of the “Pickwick Papers” appeared
in April, 1836, while the early chapters of “The Clockmaker”
were published in 1835, and were at once widely
copied by the American press, and may have been seen by
Dickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cockney dialect was used as far back as 1811 in a
farce by Samuel Beazley, architect; and no doubt the
Yankee dialect in “The Clockmaker” was not its first appearance
in literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duncan Campbell says in his “History of Nova Scotia”
(p. 335), “Sam Slick, the Clockmaker, immediately attracted
attention. The character proved to be as original and
amusing as Sam Weller. Samuel amuses us only. Slick
both amuses and instructs. Rarely do we find in any
character, not excepting the best of Scott’s, the same
degree of originality and force, combined with humor,
sagacity, and sound sense, as we find in the Clockmaker.
Industry and perseverance are effectively inculcated in
comic story and racy narrative. In the department of
instructive humor Haliburton stands, perhaps, unrivalled in
English literature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Spectator</span> (London) calls him “One of the shrewdest
of humorists;” and his biographer in Chambers’ Encyclopedia
says, “he attained a place and fame difficult to acquire
at all times—that of a man whose humor was a native of one
country and became naturalized in another, for humor is
the least exotic of the gifts of Genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philarète Chasles in the <span class='it'>Revue des Deux Mondes</span>,<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> in a
long and favorable notice of Judge Haliburton’s works,
pronounced them to be unequalled by anything that had been
written in England since the days of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long after “Sam Slick, the Clockmaker,” first appeared, it
was by many persons referred to as a store-house of practical
wisdom and common sense, and a <span class='it'>vade mecum</span> as to the
affairs of every-day life. Forty years ago an able but very
eccentric Danish Governor at St. Thomas, in the West Indies,
was noted far and wide for his excessive admiration for Sam
Slick’s works. Whenever a very knotty point arose before
him and his Council, which consisted of three persons, he
used to say “We must adjourn till to-morrow. I should like
to look into this point. I must see what Sam Slick has to
say about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A traveller on reaching the most northern town in the
world, Hammerfest, found that Sam Slick had been there
before him, for the “Clockmaker” was a hobby and a textbook
of a humorous Scotchman, who was the British consul
there at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge Haliburton was very fond of youthful society; old
men were too old for him, for he used to say that a large
majority of men when they begin to grow old become very
prosy. On the other hand, his humor and conversational
powers were very attractive to young men. In illustration
of this, the late Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who considered him the
most agreeable talker he had ever met, used to tell of meeting
him once during the shooting season, at a country house.
Next morning, to his surprise, he found all the young men
gathered around the Judge in the smoking room, instead of
their being among the turnips. They preferred hearing Sam
Slick talk to the delights of shooting.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1859, he consented to run for Launceston, where his
friend, the Duke of Northumberland, had great influence.
On his election he thanked his constituents, “in behalf of
four million of British subjects on the other side of the water,
who, up to the present time, had not one individual in the
House of Commons through whom they might be heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems almost providential that when an advocate of the
Unity of the Empire was most sorely needed, he had for a
quarter of a century been writing in favor of the colonies.
But for the strong public opinion as to their value among
the masses, whom the popularity of his works had enabled him
to reach, fanatical free-traders, in order to prevent the possibility
of a return to “the Colonial System,” might have
persuaded the nation to burn its ships by getting rid of its
colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A solitary colonist at that period in the House of Commons
soon found that he had fallen on evil times, and that among
all classes above the mass of the people, but especially among
politicians, Conservative as well as Liberal, there was a
growing hostility to the colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though no one in Parliament dared to openly advocate
disintegration, there was a settled policy on the part of a
secret clique, whose headquarters were in the Colonial Office,
to drive the colonies out of the Empire by systematic snubbing,
injustice and neglect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This infamous state of things, of which all classes of
Englishmen profess now to be ashamed, was made apparent
when Judge Haliburton moved in the House of Commons
that some months’ notice should be given of the Act to throw
open British markets to Baltic timber, a measure which, if
suddenly put in operation, would seriously injure New
Brunswick merchants; and he urged as a reason for due
consideration for that interest, that it was not represented in
Parliament. Mr. Gladstone did not condescend to give any
explanation or reply, but led his willing majority to the vote,
and the Bill was passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People sometimes cite what occurred at this debate as a
proof that “Judge Haliburton was not a success in the House
of Commons;” but it is difficult to imagine a more uncongenial
audience for an advocate of Imperial Unity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladstone, as if to remove any doubt as to his animus in
these proceedings, sent a singularly insolent reply to a letter
written to him by a New Brunswick timber merchant protesting
against this unexpected measure. “You protest, as
well as remonstrate. Were I to critically examine your
language, I could not admit your right, even individually, to
protest against any legislation which Parliament may think
fit to adopt on this matter.” Had the protest only been in
the form of dynamite he would have submissively bowed
down at the sound of that “chapel bell” which has since then
from time to time called him and his cabinets to repentance.
His two attempts to destroy the Empire, first by attacking
its extremities through Imperial disintegration, and, next, its
heart by Home Rule, alike failed; and he has retired from
public life, leaving behind him the fragments, not of a great
Empire, but of a shattered party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though a majority of both parties, Conservatives as well as
Liberals, agreed with their two leaders in their wish to get
rid of the Colonies, (for Disraeli, as far back as 1852, wrote,
“These wretched Colonies will all be independent in a few
years, and are a millstone around our neck”), the people were
wiser and more patriotic than their politicians; and in 1869
(only four years after Judge Haliburton’s death) over one
hundred and four thousand workingmen of London signed
an address to the Queen protesting against any attempt to
get rid of that heritage of the people of England—the Colonial
Empire. This memorial was not considered worthy of any
reply or acknowledgment.<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> At that time, when the fate of
England as a first-class power was in the balance, there was
no need for the masses to be “educated up” to the subject;
it was rather their statesmen and politicians that required to
be <span class='it'>educated down</span>—down to the common sense of the common
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next move against the Disintegrationists was made
four years later, in 1872, when “The United Empire
Review” revived the now familiar watchword of the old
“U. E. Loyalists” of 1776 (those Abe Lincolns, who fought
for <span class='it'>the Union</span> a hundred years ago), “a United Empire;”
and in 1873 an agitation was begun in the Premier’s own
constituency (Greenwich) against the dismemberment policy
of the Government, that six months later drove them out of
power at the general election.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Gladstone was deliberately striving to breed disunion
between the people of England, Scotland, Ireland and
“gallant little Wales,” and to get rid of our Colonial Empire,
his exact antipodes in everything, Bismarck, that <span class='it'>Colossus of
the Nineteenth Century</span>, was devoting his giant energies to
his life-work,—the unity of Germany, and the creation of a
German Colonial Empire. It is possible that, as Sam Slick’s
works are among his favorite books, he may have imbibed
to some extent Sam Slick’s ideas as to the value of our
colonies, and the incredible folly of those that wished to get
rid of them; and that we may here find a clue to the
unmeasured contempt which the Prince used so often to
openly express for English politicians. But he must have
been most interested in <span class='it'>Rule and Misrule of the English in
America</span>, one of the most profoundly philosophical and prophetic
works to be found in the literature of any country.
Published in England, and by Harper Brothers, New
York, in 1851, a troubled time all over Europe, and
even in America, which had its Tammany Hall rule, and,
later on, its “Know-nothing Movement,” it pointed out that
American republican institutions, which dated back to the
old Puritans, were of slow growth, and could not be acquired
or preserved in European countries by revolutions and universal
suffrage; and he foretold the collapse of the French
Republic, the rise of Communism, the stern rule of self-imposed
Imperialism, and nearly all the leading features of
the political history of Europe and America since that date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time, however, had a marvel in store, the fruit of half a
century of social and political development, which even he
did not foresee—a French-Canadian Roman Catholic, supported
by a Liberal majority from Quebec, ruling from ocean
to ocean over a new Dominion!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of his views, visionary as they may have appeared
fifty years ago, seem to have taken a practical shape at the
Queen’s Jubilee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The organization is all wrong. They are two people, but
not one. It shouldn’t be England and her colonies, but they
should be integral parts of one great whole—all counties of
Great Britain. There should be no tax on colonial produce,
and the colonies should not be allowed to tax British manufactures.
All should pass free, as from one town to another
in England; the whole of it one vast home market from
Hong-Kong to Labrador.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They should be represented
in Parliament, help to pass English laws, and show
them what laws they want themselves. It should no more be
a bar to a man’s promotion, as it is now, that he lived beyond
the sea, than being on the other side of the channel. It
should be our navy, our army, our nation. That’s a great
word, but the English keep it to themselves, and colonists
have no nationality. They have no place, no station, no
rank. Honors don’t reach them; coronations are blank days
to them; no brevets go across the water except to the
English officers, who are ‘on foreign service in the colonies.’
No knighthood is known there—no stars—no aristocracy—no
nobility. They are a mixed race; they have no blood. They
are like our free niggers. They are emancipated, but they
haven’t the same social position as the whites. The fetters
are off, but the caste, as they call it in India, remains.
<span class='it'>Colonists are the Pariahs of the Empire.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many persons have been surprised that the ablest colonial
statesman and journalist since the days of Franklin, the
Hon. Joseph Howe, “the father of Responsible Government,”
and an advocate of the Unity of the Empire, died without
having received any mark of Imperial recognition, while a
motley crowd of Maltese, Levantines and stray Englishmen
in the colonies were able to add a handle to their unknown
names. That this was the case need not surprise us, for the
dispensing of such favors was (and we must trust no longer
is) in the hands of those who were able, from behind the
scenes, to pull the strings of the Dismemberment movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. George Grant, D.D., in a very able address at
Halifax, on the life and times of Joseph Howe, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are, all of us, pupils of Haliburton and Howe. Is
not this a proof that, if you would know those secrets of the
future which slumber in the recesses of a nation’s thought,
unawakened as yet into consciousness, you must look for them
in the utterances of the nation’s greatest sons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before closing this sketch it is but right to mention an
instance (the only one) in which the British Government
seemed disposed to pay a tribute to the ablest author and the
most profound thinker that the Colonial Empire has yet
produced. As Judge Haliburton’s unrivalled mastery of
colonial questions eminently fitted him to be the Governor of
an important dependency, the Colonial Office offered to appoint
him President of Montserrat, a wretched little West Indian
Island, inhabited by a few white families and a thousand or
two of blacks. As the manufacture of Montserrat lime-juice
had not then been commenced the island must have been
even more desolate and woe-begone than it now is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judge Haliburton died at his residence at Isleworth, on
the banks of the Thames, where he had greatly endeared
himself to the people of the place during the few years which
he had spent among them, and was buried in the Isleworth
churchyard; and, in accordance with one of his last wishes,
his funeral was plain and unostentatious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the words of a local chronicler:—‘The village of Isleworth
will henceforth be associated with the most pleasing
reminiscences of Mr. Justice Haliburton; and the names of
Cowley, Thompson, Pope, and Walpole will find a kindred
spirit in the world-wide reputation of the author of Sam
Slick, who, like them, died on the banks of the Thames.’”<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same graveyard rests the immortal Vancouver.
Judge Haliburton, several years before his death, was told
by the sexton that a famous navigator was buried there, but
he did not remember the name, as it had become illegible on
the tombstone. It was found, on making enquiries, that the
person in question must have been Vancouver. A new
tombstone, with a suitable inscription, was placed over Vancouver’s
grave; and several years subsequently a tablet to
his memory was erected in the church. It is to be hoped
that the day will come when a suitable monument will be
raised to the great explorer; and that Westminster Abbey
and St. Paul’s may yet become the Valhalla, not only of the
Mother Country, but also of her Colonial Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It matters not that there is no public memorial to an
author whose writings created among the masses a public
opinion in favor of the colonies that baffled the dismemberment
craze of English statesmen and theorists. He will have
a monument as long as the British Empire lasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not have been conveniently <span class='it'>pigeon-holed</span>, for it required
six men to carry it; but we may assume that it never got
farther than the Home Office, and that Her Majesty never heard of it,
and therefore never replied to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The petition was written by the truest friend the colonies have ever
had—one who died in harness while working in their cause—the late
C. W. Eddy, who informed the writer that the Disintegration party had
for a time so effectually “captured” the Royal Colonial Institute, of
which he was Secretary, that the Council refused to allow the petition
to lie on the table of the reading-room on the ground that it was
“revolutionary!” So unsatisfactory was their conduct as late as 1872,
that another colonial society would have been founded, had not the
colonial element gained the day in the Institute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far the petition was “revolutionary” may be seen from the
following extracts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We beg to represent to your Majesty that we have heard with
regret and alarm that your Majesty has been advised to consent to
give up the colonies, containing millions of acres of unoccupied land,
which might be employed profitably both to the colonies and to ourselves
as a field for emigration. We respectfully submit that your
Majesty’s colonial possessions were won for your Majesty, and settled
by the valor and enterprise and the treasure of the English people;
and that, having thus become part of the national freehold and inheritance
of your Majesty’s subjects, they are held in trust by your
Majesty, and ought not to be surrendered, but transmitted to your
Majesty’s successors, as they were received by your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The petition, after urging that by proclamation the mother country
and the colonies should be declared to be one Empire, adds, “we
would also submit that your Majesty might call to your Privy Council
representatives from the colonies for the purpose of consultation on
the affairs of the more distant parts of your Majesty’s dominion.”</p>
